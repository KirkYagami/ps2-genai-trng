# Python Comprehensions

## What are Comprehensions?

Comprehensions are a Pythonic way to create collections (lists, dictionaries, sets) in a single, readable line. They combine loops and conditional logic into a concise syntax that's both efficient and expressive.

**Basic Syntax Pattern:**

```
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

## 1. List Comprehensions

### Definition

Creates a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable, optionally filtering with conditions.

### Syntax

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

### Example: Square Numbers

**Conventional Way:**

```python
# Create a list of squares for numbers 1-5
squares = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    squares.append(i ** 2)
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

**Comprehension Way:**

```python
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Use Case Scenarios

- **Data transformation**: Converting strings to uppercase, applying mathematical operations
- **Filtering data**: Getting even numbers, valid email addresses
- **API response processing**: Extracting specific fields from JSON responses
- **File processing**: Reading and transforming file contents

### Interview Tip

_"List comprehensions are 20-30% faster than equivalent for loops and are considered more Pythonic."_

## 2. Dictionary Comprehensions

### Definition

Creates dictionaries using a similar syntax to list comprehensions, allowing you to transform keys and values simultaneously.

### Syntax

```python
{key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable if condition}
```

### Example: Word Length Dictionary

**Conventional Way:**

```python
# Create a dictionary mapping words to their lengths
words = ['python', 'java', 'go', 'rust']
word_lengths = {}
for word in words:
    word_lengths[word] = len(word)
print(word_lengths)  # {'python': 6, 'java': 4, 'go': 2, 'rust': 4}
```

**Comprehension Way:**

```python
words = ['python', 'java', 'go', 'rust']
word_lengths = {word: len(word) for word in words}
print(word_lengths)  # {'python': 6, 'java': 4, 'go': 2, 'rust': 4}
```

### Use Case Scenarios

- **Data mapping**: Creating lookup tables, index mappings
- **Configuration parsing**: Converting lists to key-value pairs
- **Database results**: Transforming query results into dictionaries
- **Caching**: Creating quick lookup dictionaries for performance

### Interview Tip

_"Dictionary comprehensions are excellent for creating mappings and are more readable than using dict() with zip()."_

## 3. Set Comprehensions

### Definition

Creates sets (collections of unique elements) using comprehension syntax, automatically handling duplicates.

### Syntax

```python
{expression for item in iterable if condition}
```

### Example: Unique Word Lengths

**Conventional Way:**

```python
# Get unique lengths of words
words = ['python', 'java', 'go', 'rust', 'php']
unique_lengths = set()
for word in words:
    unique_lengths.add(len(word))
print(unique_lengths)  # {2, 3, 4, 6}
```

**Comprehension Way:**

```python
words = ['python', 'java', 'go', 'rust', 'php']
unique_lengths = {len(word) for word in words}
print(unique_lengths)  # {2, 3, 4, 6}
```

### Use Case Scenarios

- **Duplicate removal**: Getting unique values from datasets
- **Data validation**: Finding unique identifiers, email domains
- **Set operations**: Preparing data for intersection, union operations
- **Performance optimization**: Fast membership testing

### Interview Tip

_"Set comprehensions are perfect when you need unique values and don't care about order."_

## 4. Generator Expressions

### Definition

Similar to list comprehensions but create generator objects that yield items on-demand, saving memory.

### Syntax

```python
(expression for item in iterable if condition)
```

### Example: Memory-Efficient Processing

**Conventional Way:**

```python
# Process large dataset - memory intensive
def get_squares():
    result = []
    for i in range(1000000):
        result.append(i ** 2)
    return result

squares = get_squares()  # Creates entire list in memory
```

**Generator Expression Way:**

```python
# Memory efficient - generates on demand
squares = (i ** 2 for i in range(1000000))
# Only creates values when needed
for square in squares:
    if square > 100:
        break
```

### Use Case Scenarios

- **Large datasets**: Processing files, database results without loading everything
- **Pipeline processing**: Chaining transformations efficiently
- **Memory optimization**: Working with limited memory resources
- **Lazy evaluation**: Computing values only when needed

## Advanced Patterns

### Nested Comprehensions

```python
# Flatten a 2D list
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [item for row in matrix for item in row]
print(flattened)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Conditional Expressions

```python
# Different expressions based on condition
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = ['even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for x in numbers]
print(result)  # ['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd']
```

## Common Interview Questions

### Q1: "What's the difference between list comprehension and generator expression?"

**Answer:** List comprehensions create the entire list in memory immediately, while generator expressions create an iterator that yields values on-demand, saving memory for large datasets.

### Q2: "When would you NOT use comprehensions?"

**Answer:** Avoid comprehensions when:

- Logic becomes too complex (reduces readability)
- You need to handle exceptions within the loop
- Multiple operations are needed per iteration
- Debugging is difficult due to complexity

### Q3: "Are comprehensions always faster?"

**Answer:** Generally yes for simple operations, but not always. Very complex expressions or those requiring exception handling might be slower and less readable than traditional loops.

## Best Practices for Interviews

1. **Readability First**: If a comprehension becomes hard to read, use a regular loop
2. **Memory Awareness**: Use generators for large datasets
3. **Performance**: Comprehensions are generally faster for simple transformations
4. **Pythonic Code**: Comprehensions are considered more "Pythonic" when appropriate

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

```python
# List: [expr for item in iterable if condition]
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

# Dict: {key: value for item in iterable if condition}
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}

# Set: {expr for item in iterable if condition}
unique = {x % 3 for x in range(10)}

# Generator: (expr for item in iterable if condition)
gen = (x**2 for x in range(1000000))
```

## Key Takeaways

- Comprehensions make code more concise and readable
- They're generally faster than equivalent loops
- Use generators for memory efficiency with large datasets
- Don't sacrifice readability for brevity
