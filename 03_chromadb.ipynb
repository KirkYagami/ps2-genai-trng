    "### What Is a Vector Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector database is a database that allows you to efficiently store and query embedding data. Vector databases extend the capabilities of traditional relational databases to embeddings. However, the key distinguishing feature of a vector database is that query results aren’t an exact match to the query. Instead, using a specified similarity metric, the vector database returns embeddings that are _similar_ to a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this possible, vector databases are equipped with features that balance the speed and accuracy of query results. Here are the core components of a vector database that you should know about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedding function**: When using a vector database, oftentimes you’ll store and query data in its raw form, rather than uploading embeddings themselves. Internally, the vector database needs to know how to convert your data to embeddings, and you have to specify an embedding function for this. For text, you can use the embedding functions available in the SentenceTransformers library or any other function that maps raw text to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/embeddings/embedding-functions\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Similarity metric**: To assess embedding similarity, you need a similarity metric like cosine similarity, the dot product, or Euclidean distance. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Indexing**: When you’re dealing with a large number of embeddings, comparing a query embedding to every embedding stored in the database is often too slow. To overcome this, vector databases employ indexing algorithms that group similar embeddings together.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    At query time, the query embedding is compared to a smaller subset of embeddings based on the index. Because the embeddings recommended by the index aren’t guaranteed to have the highest similarity to the query, this is called approximate nearest neighbor search.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Metadata**: You can store metadata with each embedding to help give context and make query results more precise. You can filter your embedding searches on metadata much like you would in a relational database. For example, you could store the year that a document was published as metadata and only look for similar documents that were published in a given year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Storage location**: With any kind of database, you need a place to store the data. Vector databases can store embeddings and metadata both in memory and on disk. Keeping data in memory allows for faster reads and writes, while writing to disk is important for persistent storage.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **CRUD operations**: Most vector databases support create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. This means you can maintain and interact with data like you would in a relational database.\n"
