Who discovered the Galapagos Islands and how?,"['Because of subsequent evolutionary adaptations, an amazing range of subspecies are found on the islands today. Galapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine iguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Other species of interest include the flightless cormorant and the blue-footed booby. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young. The islands’ human inhabitants, mostly Ecuadorans, live in settlements on San Cristóbal, Santa María, Isabela, and Santa Cruz islands; Baltra has an Ecuadoran military base. Some of the islands are virtually untouched by humans, but many have been altered by the introduction of nonnative plants, the growth of the local human population, and tourist traffic. Tourism, fishing, and agriculture are the main economic activities.

The Galapagos consist of 13 major islands (ranging in area from 5.4 to 1,771 square miles [14 to 4,588 square km]), 6 smaller islands, and scores of islets and rocks lying athwart the Equator 600 miles (1,000 km) west of the mainland of Ecuador. Their total land area of 3,093 square miles (8,010 square km) is scattered over 23,000 square miles (59,500 square km) of ocean. The government of Ecuador designated part of the Galapagos a wildlife sanctuary in 1935, and in 1959 the sanctuary became the Galapagos National Park. In 1978 the islands were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, and in 1986 the Galapagos Marine Resources Reserve was created to protect the surrounding waters. The Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz (Indefatigable) Island promotes scientific studies and protects the indigenous vegetation and animal life of the Galapagos. The Galapagos Islands are formed of lava piles and dotted with shield volcanoes, many of which are periodically active. The striking ruggedness of the arid landscape is accentuated by high volcanic mountains, craters, and cliffs. The largest of the islands, Isabela (Albemarle), is approximately 82 miles (132 km) long and constitutes more than half of the total land area of the archipelago; it contains Mount Azul, at 5,541 feet (1,689 metres) the highest point of the Galapagos Islands. The second largest island is Santa Cruz. The Galapagos Islands were discovered in 1535 by the bishop of Panama, Tomás de Berlanga, whose ship had drifted off course while en route to Peru. He named them Las Encantadas (“The Enchanted”), and in his writings he marveled at the thousands of large galápagos (tortoises) found there. Numerous Spanish voyagers stopped at the islands from the 16th century, and the Galapagos also came to be used by pirates and by whale and seal hunters. The area had been unclaimed for almost 300 years before colonization began on what is now Santa María Island in 1832, when Ecuador took official possession of the archipelago. The islands became internationally famous as a result of their being visited in 1835 by the English naturalist Charles Darwin; their unusual fauna contributed to the groundbreaking theories on natural selection presented in his On the Origin of Species (1859). Island, New Caledonia. Britannica Quiz  Islands and Archipelagos  The climate of the Galapagos Islands is characterized by low rainfall, low humidity, and relatively low air and water temperatures. The islands have thousands of plant and animal species, of which the vast majority are endemic. The archipelago’s arid lowlands are covered by an open cactus forest. A transition zone at higher elevations is covered with a forest in which pisonia (a four o’clock plant) and guava trees dominate, and the moist forest region above the transition zone is dominated by a Scalesia forest with dense underbrush. The treeless upland zone is covered with ferns and grasses."", 'The archipelago is renowned for its unusual animal life. Its giant tortoises are thought to have some of the longest life spans (up to 150 years) of any creature on Earth. The close affinities of Galapagos animals to the fauna of South and Central America indicate that most of the islands’ species originated there.', 'Rafferty.

The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in gangs, including the Black Spades.[532] The Mafia and gang presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.[533][534]  The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) provides fire protection, technical rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and emergency medical services. FDNY faces multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise structures, the FDNY responds to fires that occur in the New York City Subway.[535] Secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires, also present challenges. The FDNY is headquartered at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn,[536] and the FDNY Fire Academy is on Randalls Island.[537]  Transportation  Main article: Transportation in New York City  Rapid transit  Mass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the country, and two-thirds of the nation\'s rail riders live in the New York City metropolitan area.[540][541]  Buses  New York City\'s public bus fleet runs 24/7 and is the largest in North America.[542] The New York City bus system serves the most passengers of any city in the nation: In 2022, MTA New York City Transit\'s buses served 483.5 million trips, while MTA Regional Bus Operations handled 100.3 million trips.[543]  The Port Authority Bus Terminal is the city\'s main intercity bus terminal and the world\'s busiest bus station, serving 250,000 passengers on 7,000 buses each workday in a building opened in 1950 that was designed to accommodate 60,000 daily passengers. A 2021 plan announced by the Port Authority would spend $10 billion to expand capacity and modernize the facility.[539][544][538] In 2024, the Port Authority announced plans for a new terminal that would feature a glass atrium at a new main entrance on 41st Street.[545][546]  Rail  Main article: New York City Subway  The New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York\'s subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to most subway systems.[547] The New York City Subway is the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere,[548] with 1.70 billion passenger rides in 2019.[549]  Public transport is widely used in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit.[550] This is in contrast to the rest of the country, where 91% of commuters travel in automobiles to their workplace.[551] According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities.[552] New York is the only American city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car.[553] Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.[554]  New York City\'s commuter rail network is the largest in North America.[540] The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and New York Penn Station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines.[540] The elevated AirTrain JFK in Queens connects JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road.[555] For inter-city rail, New York City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Penn Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North American cities.[556]  The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day, with access to Manhattan from the St. George Terminal via the Staten Island Ferry.[557] The PATH train links Midtown and Lower Manhattan with Hoboken Terminal and Newark Penn Station in New Jersey, and then those stations with the World Trade Center Oculus across the Hudson River.[558] Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day, meaning three of the five American rapid transit systems that operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York.[559] Grand Central Terminal is the world\'s largest train station by number of rail platforms and acres occupied.[560]  Multibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second Avenue Subway.[561]  Air  Main article: Aviation in the New York metropolitan area  New York\'s airspace is the busiest in the United States and one of the world\'s busiest air corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area are John F. Kennedy International Airport (with 55.3 million passengers), Newark Liberty International Airport (43.6 million) and LaGuardia Airport (29.0 million); 127.9 million travelers used these three airports in 2022.[562] JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth-busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2023.[563] As of 2011[update], JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America.[564]  Described in 2014 by then-Vice President Joe Biden as the kind of airport travelers would see in ""some third world country"", LaGuardia Airport has undergone an $8 billion project with federal and state support that has replaced its aging facilities with modern terminals and roadways.[565][566][567][568] Plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart International Airport, near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[569] Other commercial airports in or serving the New York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton–Mercer Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport serving the area is Teterboro Airport. Ferries, taxis and trams  Main articles: Staten Island Ferry, NYC Ferry, Taxis of New York City, and Roosevelt Island Tramway  The Staten Island Ferry is the world\'s busiest ferry, carrying more than 23 million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on a 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running 24/7.[570][571] Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area. NYC Ferry, a NYCEDC initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017.[572]  Identified by their color and taxi medallion, the city\'s 13,587 yellow taxicabs are the only vehicles allowed to pick up riders making street hails throughout the city.[573] Apple green-colored boro taxis can pick up street hails in Upper Manhattan and the four outer boroughs.[574] Long dominated by yellow taxis, high-volume for-hire vehicles from Uber and Lyft have provided the most trips in the city since December 2016, when the for-hire vehicles and cabs each had about 10.5 million trips. By October 2023, the 78,000 vehicles-for-hire combined for 20.3 million trips, while 3.5 million trips were in yellow taxis.[575][576]  The Roosevelt Island Tramway, an aerial tramway that began operation in 1976,[577] transports 2 million passengers per year the 3,140 feet (960 m) between Roosevelt Island and 59th Street and Second Avenue on Manhattan Island.[578]  Cycling network  Main article: Cycling in New York City  New York City has mixed cycling conditions, which include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with stop-and-go traffic, and many pedestrians. The city\'s large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; recreational cycling clubs; and an increasing number of commuters. Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2022 there were approximately 61,200 people who commuted daily using a bicycle and 610,000 daily bike trips, both nearly doubling over the previous decade.[229] As of 2022[update], New York City had 1,525 miles (2,454 km) of bike lanes, including 644 miles (1,036 km) of segregated or ""protected"" bike lanes citywide.[229]  Streets and highways  Streets are also a defining feature of the city. New York has been found to lead the world in urban automobile traffic congestion.[34] The Commissioners\' Plan of 1811 greatly influenced its physical development. New York City has an extensive web of freeways and parkways, which link the city\'s boroughs to each other and North Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through bridges and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is common for motorists to be stranded for hours in dense traffic congestion that is a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour.[579][580] Congestion pricing in New York City, first such program in the nation,[581] was activated in January 2025, applying to most motor vehicular traffic using the area of Manhattan south of 60th Street, in an effort to encourage commuters to use rapid transit instead.[582] Unlike the rest of the country, New York State prohibits turns on red lights in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns on red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.[583]  Bridges and tunnels  Further information: List of bridges and tunnels in New York City and Commissioners\' Plan of 1811  The boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are located on islands with the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are at the western end of the larger Long Island, and the Bronx is on New York State\'s mainland. Manhattan Island is linked to the outer boroughs and New Jersey by an extensive network of bridges and tunnels. The 14-lane George Washington Bridge, connecting Manhattan to New Jersey across the Hudson River, is the world\'s busiest motor vehicle bridge.[584][585] The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, spanning the Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island, is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world\'s longest.[586][587] The Brooklyn Bridge, with its stone neo-Gothic suspension towers, is an icon of the city; opened in 1883, it was the first steel-wire suspension bridge and was the longest suspension bridge in the world until 1903.[588][589] The Queensboro Bridge ""was the longest cantilever span in North America"" from 1909 to 1917.[590] The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, ""is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges"", and its design ""served as the model for the major long-span suspension bridges"" of the early 20th century.[591] The Throgs Neck Bridge and Whitestone Bridge connect Queens and the Bronx, while the Triborough Bridge connects Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.[592] The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan\'s piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927.[593][594] The Queens–Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940.[595] The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel (officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) is the longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnel in North America and runs underneath Battery Park, connecting the Financial District, Manhattan, to Red Hook, Brooklyn.[596]  Government and politics  Main articles: Government of New York City, Politics of New York City, and Elections in New York City  Government  New York City is a metropolitan municipality with a strong mayor–council form of government.[597] The city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. The City Council is a unicameral body of 51 council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries.[598] Each term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a two consecutive-term limit,[599] (reset after a four-year break). The New York City Administrative Code, the New York City Rules, and The City Record are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official journal, respectively.[600][601]  Each borough is coextensive with a judicial district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, while Brooklyn hosts the Second Department. There are several extrajudicial administrative courts, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System. New York City is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different U.S. district courts: the District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse is on Foley Square in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx;[602] and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.[603] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and U.S. Court of International Trade are also based on Foley Square.[604][605]  Politics  The city\'s mayor is Eric Adams, a Democrat who was elected in 2021.[606] The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of November 2023, 67% of active registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10.2% are Republicans.[607] New York City has not been carried by a Republican presidential candidate since 1924, and no Republican candidate for statewide office has won all five boroughs since the city was incorporated in 1898. In redistricting following the 2020 census, 14 of New York\'s 26 congressional districts include portions of New York City.[608]  New York City is a significant source of political fundraising.[609] The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also sent an additional $4.1 billion in the 2009–2010 fiscal year to the state than the city received in return.[610]  International relations  Main article: List of sister cities of New York City  In 2006, the sister city program[611] was restructured as New York City Global Partners.

It is located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world\'s largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each coextensive with its respective county. The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a global center of finance[13] and commerce, culture, technology,[14] entertainment and media, academics and scientific output,[15] the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy.[16][17][18][19][20]  With an estimated population in July 2024 of 8,478,072, distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2),[5] the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States.[6][7] New York City has more than double the population of Los Angeles, the country\'s second-most populous city.[21] Over 20.1 million people live in New York City\'s metropolitan statistical area[22] and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, both the largest in the U.S. New York City is one of the world\'s most populous megacities.[23] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. An estimated 800 languages are spoken in New York City,[24][25][26] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[27][28] The New York City metropolitan region is home to the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world, approximately 5.9 million as of 2023. New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York,[29] before being permanently renamed New York in 1674. Following independence from Great Britain, the city was the national capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[30] The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world\'s premier financial and fintech center[31][32] and the most economically powerful city in the world.[33] As of 2022[update], the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion.[11] The New York metropolitan area\'s economy is larger than all but nine countries. Despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system, New York also leads the world in urban automobile traffic congestion.[34] The city is home to the world\'s two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is an established haven for global investors.[35] As of 2025[update], New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates[36] and has by a wide margin the highest residential rents of any city in the nation.[37] Fifth Avenue is the most expensive shopping street in the world.[38] New York City is home to the highest number of billionaires,[39] individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million),[40] and millionaires of any city in the world by a significant margin.[41]  Etymology  See also: Nicknames of New York City  In 1664, New York was named in honor of the Duke of York (later King James II of England).[42] James\'s elder brother, King Charles II, appointed him proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when the Kingdom of England seized it from Dutch control.[43] At the same time, New Netherland was also renamed New York (province, now New York State).[44]  History  Main articles: History of New York City and Timeline of New York City  Further information: History of Manhattan, Timeline of Brooklyn, Timeline of Queens, Timeline of the Bronx, and Timeline of Staten Island  Early history  Main article: History of New York City (prehistory–1664)  In the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquians, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.[45]  The first documented visit to New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano.[46] He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême).[47] A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Río de San Antonio (\'Saint Anthony\'s River\').[48]  In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.[49] He sailed up what the Dutch called North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange.[50]  Hudson claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (\'New Netherland\'). The first non–Native American inhabitant of what became New York City was Juan Rodriguez, a merchant from Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch.[51][52]  Dutch rule  Main articles: New Amsterdam, Fort Amsterdam, and New Netherland    The Castello Plan, a 1660 map of New Amsterdam in Lower Manhattan    New Amsterdam, centered in what eventually became Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it New York  A permanent European presence near New York Harbor was established in 1624, making New York the 12th-oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States, with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.[53][54]  The colony of New Amsterdam extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7 m) wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids.[55] In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[56] for ""the value of 60 guilders""[57] (about $900 in 2018).[58] A frequently told but disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[59][60]  Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[29] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded land, local political autonomy, and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[61]  Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639–1640, to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[29][62]  In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[63][64] Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order; however, he earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups from establishing houses of worship.[65]  English rule  Main articles: Province of New York and History of New York City (1665–1783)    The Fall of New Amsterdam, painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris, depicting the Conquest of New Netherland    Fort George and New York with British warships, c. 1731  In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed.[65][66] The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[67]  In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the victorious Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname, which they had gained from the English,[68] and in return the English kept New Amsterdam. The settlement was promptly renamed ""New York"" after the Duke of York (the future King James II and VII).[3] The duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley.[69]  On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Anthony Colve of the Dutch navy seized New York at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it ""New Orange"" after William III, the Prince of Orange.[70] The Dutch soon returned the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.[71][72]  Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between 1660 and 1670.[73] By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.[74] New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population in 1702 alone.[75][76]  In the early 18th century, New York grew in importance as a trading port as a part of the colony of New York.[77] It became a center of slavery, with 42% of households enslaving Africans by 1730.[78] Most were domestic slaves; others were hired out as labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York\'s economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the American South. During construction in Foley Square in the 1990s, the African Burying Ground was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 graves of colonial-era Africans, some enslaved and some free.[79]  The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish freedom of the press in North America.[80] In 1754, Columbia University was founded.[81]  American Revolution  Further information: American Revolution  The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.[82] The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within modern-day Brooklyn.[83] A British rout of the Continental Army at the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776 eliminated the last American stronghold in Manhattan, causing George Washington and his forces to retreat across the Hudson River to New Jersey, pursued by British forces.[84][85]  After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made New York their military and political base of operations in North America.[86] The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom promised by the Crown, with as many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation, the largest such community on the continent.[87][88] When the British forces evacuated New York at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia, England, and the Caribbean.[89]  The attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776.[90] Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York destroyed nearly 500 buildings, about a quarter of the structures in the city, including Trinity Church.[91][92]  Post-revolutionary period and early 19th century  Main article: History of New York City (1784–1854)  In January 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital.[93] New York was the last capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation and the first under the Constitution.[94] As the capital, New York City hosted the inauguration of the first President, George Washington, and the first Congress, at Federal Hall on Wall Street. Congress drafted the Bill of Rights there.[94] The Supreme Court held its first organizational sessions in New York in 1790. In 1790, for the first time, New York City surpassed Philadelphia as the nation\'s largest city. At the end of 1790, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia, where it remained while the new capital in Washington, D.C. was being constructed.[95][96]  During the 19th century New York City\'s population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million.[97] Under New York State\'s gradual emancipation act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.[98][99] A significant free Black population gradually developed in Manhattan, made up of former slaves who had been freed by their masters after the American Revolutionary War, as well as escaped slaves. The New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children.[100] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state.[101] Free Blacks struggled with discrimination, and interracial abolitionist activism continued. New York City\'s population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 (10,886 of whom were Black and of whom 518 were enslaved) to 312,710 by 1840 (16,358 of whom were Black).[102]  Also in the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration, respectively.[104] The city adopted the Commissioners\' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.[105] Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.[106] In 1831, New York University was founded.[107]  Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Members of the business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.[108]  The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, of whom more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, representing over a quarter of the city\'s population.[109] Extensive immigration from the German provinces meant that Germans comprised another 25% of New York\'s population by 1860.[110][111]  American Civil War  Main articles: New York City in the American Civil War and History of New York City (1855–1897)  Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city\'s ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[100] Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[100]  The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York\'s elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground.[110] At least 120 people were killed.[112] Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865. The White working class had established dominance.[110][112] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.[113]  Late 19th and early 20th century  Main articles: History of New York City (1898–1945) and History of New York City (1946–1977)  In 1886, the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was dedicated in New York Harbor. The statue welcomed 14 million immigrants as they arrived via Ellis Island by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the United States and American ideals of liberty and peace.[114][115]  In 1898 the City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.[116] The opening of the New York City Subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together.[117] Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.[118]  In 1904 the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people.[119] In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city\'s worst industrial disaster, killed 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies\' Garment Workers\' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.[120]  New York\'s non-White population was 36,620 in 1890.[121] New York City was a prime destination in the early 20th century for Blacks during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had the largest urban African diaspora in North America.[122] The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition.[123] The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height.[124]  New York City became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed 10 million in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity.[125] The Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[126]  Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County, with Wall Street leading America\'s place as the world\'s dominant economic power. The United Nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York\'s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York\'s displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.[127]  Late 20th and early 21st centuries  Main articles: History of New York City (1978–present) and September 11 attacks  In 1969 the Stonewall riots were a series of violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village.[131] They are widely considered to be the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement[128][132][133][134] and the modern fight for LGBT rights.[135][136] Wayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only ""transgender folks around"" during the Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality.[137]  In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[138] Growing fiscal deficits in 1975 led the city to appeal to the federal government for financial aid; President Gerald Ford gave a speech denying the request, which was paraphrased on the front page of the New York Daily News as ""FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD"".[139] The Municipal Assistance Corporation was formed and granted oversight authority over the city\'s finances.[140] While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city\'s economic health in the 1980s, New York\'s crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[141]  New York City\'s population passed 8 million for the first time in the 2000 census;[142] further records were set in the 2010 and 2020 censuses.[143] Important new economic sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged.[144]  The year 2000 was celebrated with fanfare in Times Square.[145]  New York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.[146] Two of the four hijacked airliners were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, resulting in the collapse of both buildings and the deaths of 2,753 people, including 343 first responders from the New York City Fire Department and 71 law enforcement officers.[147]  The area was rebuilt with a new World Trade Center, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure,[148] including the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city\'s third-largest hub.[149] The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere[150] and the world\'s seventh-tallest building by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m), a reference to the year of American independence.[151][152][153]  The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[154]  New York City was heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, including flooding that led to the days-long shutdown of the subway system,[155] and flooding of all East River subway tunnels and of all road tunnels entering Manhattan except the Lincoln Tunnel.[156] The New York Stock Exchange closed for two days due to weather for the first time since the Great Blizzard of 1888.[157] At least 43 people died in New York City as a result of Sandy, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion.[158] The disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter climate change and rising seas, with $15 billion in federal funding received through 2022 towards those resiliency efforts.[159][160]  In March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in the city was confirmed.[161] With its population density and extensive exposure to global travelers, the city rapidly replaced Wuhan, China as the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, straining the city\'s healthcare infrastructure.[162][163] Through March 2023, New York City recorded more than 80,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications.[164]  Geography  Main articles: Geography of New York City and Geography of New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary  New York City lies in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.']","The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel (officially the Hugh L.

Are Penguins found in the Galapagos Islands?,"['Because of subsequent evolutionary adaptations, an amazing range of subspecies are found on the islands today. Galapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine iguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Other species of interest include the flightless cormorant and the blue-footed booby. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young. The islands’ human inhabitants, mostly Ecuadorans, live in settlements on San Cristóbal, Santa María, Isabela, and Santa Cruz islands; Baltra has an Ecuadoran military base. Some of the islands are virtually untouched by humans, but many have been altered by the introduction of nonnative plants, the growth of the local human population, and tourist traffic. Tourism, fishing, and agriculture are the main economic activities. Pop.', 'When it’s particularly cold, large groups of penguins – sometimes in the millions! – will huddle for warmth, rotating so each one gets a turn in the warm middle. This behaviour among Emperor penguins is so effective that it can cut heat loss by a half, with the inside reaching a toasty 37.5 °C. Though most people associate penguins with snow and ice, they can also be spotted in forests in New Zealand, on volcanic islands of the Galapagos, and beaches of southern Africa. Penguins may not be able to fly, but they more than make up for it with their swimming skills – necessary as they spend most of their lives in the water. With flippers instead of wings, penguins can swim 15 miles an hour and do most of their hunting in the deep where they catch krill, squid, and fish. On land, they stand upright and waddle or run, or when in a hurry can switch to ‘tobogganing’ by lying on their stomach and using their flippers to propel, steer, and brake. Emperor penguins are the only penguin species to breed during the cold, dark Antarctic winter. After laying a single egg, the female leaves the male in charge of the egg while she takes a long hunting trip. Rather than sit on the egg like most birds, the male balances the egg on his feet, protected and kept warm in feathered skin called a brood pouch. The male doesn’t feed for the whole time the female is away, which can be as long as two months.

Penguins are sadly one of the most threatened groups of seabirds, with half of the 18 species listed by Birdlife as either Vulnerable or Endangered. While penguins are well adapted to their environments, human impacts are hitting their homes too hard and too fast for them to cope. The threats are numerous, including habitat loss, pollution, disease, and reduced food availability due to commercial fishing.

The Galapagos consist of 13 major islands (ranging in area from 5.4 to 1,771 square miles [14 to 4,588 square km]), 6 smaller islands, and scores of islets and rocks lying athwart the Equator 600 miles (1,000 km) west of the mainland of Ecuador. Their total land area of 3,093 square miles (8,010 square km) is scattered over 23,000 square miles (59,500 square km) of ocean. The government of Ecuador designated part of the Galapagos a wildlife sanctuary in 1935, and in 1959 the sanctuary became the Galapagos National Park. In 1978 the islands were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, and in 1986 the Galapagos Marine Resources Reserve was created to protect the surrounding waters. The Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz (Indefatigable) Island promotes scientific studies and protects the indigenous vegetation and animal life of the Galapagos. The Galapagos Islands are formed of lava piles and dotted with shield volcanoes, many of which are periodically active. The striking ruggedness of the arid landscape is accentuated by high volcanic mountains, craters, and cliffs. The largest of the islands, Isabela (Albemarle), is approximately 82 miles (132 km) long and constitutes more than half of the total land area of the archipelago; it contains Mount Azul, at 5,541 feet (1,689 metres) the highest point of the Galapagos Islands. The second largest island is Santa Cruz. The Galapagos Islands were discovered in 1535 by the bishop of Panama, Tomás de Berlanga, whose ship had drifted off course while en route to Peru. He named them Las Encantadas (“The Enchanted”), and in his writings he marveled at the thousands of large galápagos (tortoises) found there. Numerous Spanish voyagers stopped at the islands from the 16th century, and the Galapagos also came to be used by pirates and by whale and seal hunters. The area had been unclaimed for almost 300 years before colonization began on what is now Santa María Island in 1832, when Ecuador took official possession of the archipelago. The islands became internationally famous as a result of their being visited in 1835 by the English naturalist Charles Darwin; their unusual fauna contributed to the groundbreaking theories on natural selection presented in his On the Origin of Species (1859). Island, New Caledonia. Britannica Quiz  Islands and Archipelagos  The climate of the Galapagos Islands is characterized by low rainfall, low humidity, and relatively low air and water temperatures. The islands have thousands of plant and animal species, of which the vast majority are endemic. The archipelago’s arid lowlands are covered by an open cactus forest.

What are the threats to penguin populations?,"['PENGUINS  Watching penguins waddle across slippery ice or huddle together for warmth will melt the most frozen of hearts. Here at BirdLife, we can’t imagine a world without penguins. But despite their charm and worldwide popularity, they are marching toward extinction. Penguins are sadly one of the most threatened groups of seabirds, with half of the 18 species listed by Birdlife as either Vulnerable or Endangered. While penguins are well adapted to their environments, human impacts are hitting their homes too hard and too fast for them to cope. The threats are numerous, including habitat loss, pollution, disease, and reduced food availability due to commercial fishing. Climate change is of particular concern for many species of penguin, as the sea ice that they depend on to find food or build nests is melting before their eyes. Family: Spheniscidae Diet: Carnivore Life span: 15–20 years Weight: 1 – 40 kg Group name: colony, rookery, or waddle (on land), raft (at sea)  Species information  Learn more about each species of penguin and all other birds on our Datazone  Explore the Datazone  Did you know? Most penguins live around frozen Antarctica, where they experience some of the most extreme conditions on Earth.', 'When it’s particularly cold, large groups of penguins – sometimes in the millions! – will huddle for warmth, rotating so each one gets a turn in the warm middle. This behaviour among Emperor penguins is so effective that it can cut heat loss by a half, with the inside reaching a toasty 37.5 °C. Though most people associate penguins with snow and ice, they can also be spotted in forests in New Zealand, on volcanic islands of the Galapagos, and beaches of southern Africa. Penguins may not be able to fly, but they more than make up for it with their swimming skills – necessary as they spend most of their lives in the water. With flippers instead of wings, penguins can swim 15 miles an hour and do most of their hunting in the deep where they catch krill, squid, and fish. On land, they stand upright and waddle or run, or when in a hurry can switch to ‘tobogganing’ by lying on their stomach and using their flippers to propel, steer, and brake. Emperor penguins are the only penguin species to breed during the cold, dark Antarctic winter. After laying a single egg, the female leaves the male in charge of the egg while she takes a long hunting trip. Rather than sit on the egg like most birds, the male balances the egg on his feet, protected and kept warm in feathered skin called a brood pouch. The male doesn’t feed for the whole time the female is away, which can be as long as two months.

It is located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world\'s largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each coextensive with its respective county. The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a global center of finance[13] and commerce, culture, technology,[14] entertainment and media, academics and scientific output,[15] the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy.[16][17][18][19][20]  With an estimated population in July 2024 of 8,478,072, distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2),[5] the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States.[6][7] New York City has more than double the population of Los Angeles, the country\'s second-most populous city.[21] Over 20.1 million people live in New York City\'s metropolitan statistical area[22] and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, both the largest in the U.S. New York City is one of the world\'s most populous megacities.[23] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. An estimated 800 languages are spoken in New York City,[24][25][26] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[27][28] The New York City metropolitan region is home to the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world, approximately 5.9 million as of 2023. New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York,[29] before being permanently renamed New York in 1674. Following independence from Great Britain, the city was the national capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[30] The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world\'s premier financial and fintech center[31][32] and the most economically powerful city in the world.[33] As of 2022[update], the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion.[11] The New York metropolitan area\'s economy is larger than all but nine countries. Despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system, New York also leads the world in urban automobile traffic congestion.[34] The city is home to the world\'s two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is an established haven for global investors.[35] As of 2025[update], New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates[36] and has by a wide margin the highest residential rents of any city in the nation.[37] Fifth Avenue is the most expensive shopping street in the world.[38] New York City is home to the highest number of billionaires,[39] individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million),[40] and millionaires of any city in the world by a significant margin.[41]  Etymology  See also: Nicknames of New York City  In 1664, New York was named in honor of the Duke of York (later King James II of England).[42] James\'s elder brother, King Charles II, appointed him proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when the Kingdom of England seized it from Dutch control.[43] At the same time, New Netherland was also renamed New York (province, now New York State).[44]  History  Main articles: History of New York City and Timeline of New York City  Further information: History of Manhattan, Timeline of Brooklyn, Timeline of Queens, Timeline of the Bronx, and Timeline of Staten Island  Early history  Main article: History of New York City (prehistory–1664)  In the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquians, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.[45]  The first documented visit to New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano.[46] He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême).[47] A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Río de San Antonio (\'Saint Anthony\'s River\').[48]  In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.[49] He sailed up what the Dutch called North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange.[50]  Hudson claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (\'New Netherland\'). The first non–Native American inhabitant of what became New York City was Juan Rodriguez, a merchant from Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch.[51][52]  Dutch rule  Main articles: New Amsterdam, Fort Amsterdam, and New Netherland    The Castello Plan, a 1660 map of New Amsterdam in Lower Manhattan    New Amsterdam, centered in what eventually became Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it New York  A permanent European presence near New York Harbor was established in 1624, making New York the 12th-oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States, with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.[53][54]  The colony of New Amsterdam extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7 m) wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids.[55] In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[56] for ""the value of 60 guilders""[57] (about $900 in 2018).[58] A frequently told but disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[59][60]  Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[29] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded land, local political autonomy, and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[61]  Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639–1640, to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[29][62]  In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[63][64] Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order; however, he earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups from establishing houses of worship.[65]  English rule  Main articles: Province of New York and History of New York City (1665–1783)    The Fall of New Amsterdam, painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris, depicting the Conquest of New Netherland    Fort George and New York with British warships, c. 1731  In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed.[65][66] The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[67]  In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the victorious Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname, which they had gained from the English,[68] and in return the English kept New Amsterdam. The settlement was promptly renamed ""New York"" after the Duke of York (the future King James II and VII).[3] The duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley.[69]  On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Anthony Colve of the Dutch navy seized New York at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it ""New Orange"" after William III, the Prince of Orange.[70] The Dutch soon returned the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.[71][72]  Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between 1660 and 1670.[73] By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.[74] New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population in 1702 alone.[75][76]  In the early 18th century, New York grew in importance as a trading port as a part of the colony of New York.[77] It became a center of slavery, with 42% of households enslaving Africans by 1730.[78] Most were domestic slaves; others were hired out as labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York\'s economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the American South. During construction in Foley Square in the 1990s, the African Burying Ground was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 graves of colonial-era Africans, some enslaved and some free.[79]  The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish freedom of the press in North America.[80] In 1754, Columbia University was founded.[81]  American Revolution  Further information: American Revolution  The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.[82] The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within modern-day Brooklyn.[83] A British rout of the Continental Army at the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776 eliminated the last American stronghold in Manhattan, causing George Washington and his forces to retreat across the Hudson River to New Jersey, pursued by British forces.[84][85]  After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made New York their military and political base of operations in North America.[86] The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom promised by the Crown, with as many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation, the largest such community on the continent.[87][88] When the British forces evacuated New York at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia, England, and the Caribbean.[89]  The attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776.[90] Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York destroyed nearly 500 buildings, about a quarter of the structures in the city, including Trinity Church.[91][92]  Post-revolutionary period and early 19th century  Main article: History of New York City (1784–1854)  In January 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital.[93] New York was the last capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation and the first under the Constitution.[94] As the capital, New York City hosted the inauguration of the first President, George Washington, and the first Congress, at Federal Hall on Wall Street. Congress drafted the Bill of Rights there.[94] The Supreme Court held its first organizational sessions in New York in 1790. In 1790, for the first time, New York City surpassed Philadelphia as the nation\'s largest city. At the end of 1790, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia, where it remained while the new capital in Washington, D.C. was being constructed.[95][96]  During the 19th century New York City\'s population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million.[97] Under New York State\'s gradual emancipation act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.[98][99] A significant free Black population gradually developed in Manhattan, made up of former slaves who had been freed by their masters after the American Revolutionary War, as well as escaped slaves. The New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children.[100] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state.[101] Free Blacks struggled with discrimination, and interracial abolitionist activism continued. New York City\'s population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 (10,886 of whom were Black and of whom 518 were enslaved) to 312,710 by 1840 (16,358 of whom were Black).[102]  Also in the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration, respectively.[104] The city adopted the Commissioners\' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.[105] Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.[106] In 1831, New York University was founded.[107]  Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Members of the business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.[108]  The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, of whom more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, representing over a quarter of the city\'s population.[109] Extensive immigration from the German provinces meant that Germans comprised another 25% of New York\'s population by 1860.[110][111]  American Civil War  Main articles: New York City in the American Civil War and History of New York City (1855–1897)  Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city\'s ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[100] Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[100]  The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York\'s elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground.[110] At least 120 people were killed.[112] Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865. The White working class had established dominance.[110][112] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.[113]  Late 19th and early 20th century  Main articles: History of New York City (1898–1945) and History of New York City (1946–1977)  In 1886, the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was dedicated in New York Harbor. The statue welcomed 14 million immigrants as they arrived via Ellis Island by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the United States and American ideals of liberty and peace.[114][115]  In 1898 the City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.[116] The opening of the New York City Subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together.[117] Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.[118]  In 1904 the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people.[119] In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city\'s worst industrial disaster, killed 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies\' Garment Workers\' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.[120]  New York\'s non-White population was 36,620 in 1890.[121] New York City was a prime destination in the early 20th century for Blacks during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had the largest urban African diaspora in North America.[122] The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition.[123] The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height.[124]  New York City became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed 10 million in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity.[125] The Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[126]  Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County, with Wall Street leading America\'s place as the world\'s dominant economic power. The United Nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York\'s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York\'s displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.[127]  Late 20th and early 21st centuries  Main articles: History of New York City (1978–present) and September 11 attacks  In 1969 the Stonewall riots were a series of violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village.[131] They are widely considered to be the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement[128][132][133][134] and the modern fight for LGBT rights.[135][136] Wayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only ""transgender folks around"" during the Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality.[137]  In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[138] Growing fiscal deficits in 1975 led the city to appeal to the federal government for financial aid; President Gerald Ford gave a speech denying the request, which was paraphrased on the front page of the New York Daily News as ""FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD"".[139] The Municipal Assistance Corporation was formed and granted oversight authority over the city\'s finances.[140] While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city\'s economic health in the 1980s, New York\'s crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[141]  New York City\'s population passed 8 million for the first time in the 2000 census;[142] further records were set in the 2010 and 2020 censuses.[143] Important new economic sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged.[144]  The year 2000 was celebrated with fanfare in Times Square.[145]  New York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.[146] Two of the four hijacked airliners were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, resulting in the collapse of both buildings and the deaths of 2,753 people, including 343 first responders from the New York City Fire Department and 71 law enforcement officers.[147]  The area was rebuilt with a new World Trade Center, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure,[148] including the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city\'s third-largest hub.[149] The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere[150] and the world\'s seventh-tallest building by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m), a reference to the year of American independence.[151][152][153]  The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[154]  New York City was heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, including flooding that led to the days-long shutdown of the subway system,[155] and flooding of all East River subway tunnels and of all road tunnels entering Manhattan except the Lincoln Tunnel.[156] The New York Stock Exchange closed for two days due to weather for the first time since the Great Blizzard of 1888.[157] At least 43 people died in New York City as a result of Sandy, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion.[158] The disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter climate change and rising seas, with $15 billion in federal funding received through 2022 towards those resiliency efforts.[159][160]  In March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in the city was confirmed.[161] With its population density and extensive exposure to global travelers, the city rapidly replaced Wuhan, China as the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, straining the city\'s healthcare infrastructure.[162][163] Through March 2023, New York City recorded more than 80,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications.[164]  Geography  Main articles: Geography of New York City and Geography of New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary  New York City lies in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.', 'Retrieved August 20, 2017. ^ Jump up to: a b c Highest Density States, Counties and Cities (2022), United States Census Bureau.

It is located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world\'s largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each coextensive with its respective county. The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a global center of finance[13] and commerce, culture, technology,[14] entertainment and media, academics and scientific output,[15] the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy.[16][17][18][19][20]  With an estimated population in July 2024 of 8,478,072, distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2),[5] the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States.[6][7] New York City has more than double the population of Los Angeles, the country\'s second-most populous city.[21] Over 20.1 million people live in New York City\'s metropolitan statistical area[22] and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, both the largest in the U.S. New York City is one of the world\'s most populous megacities.[23] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. An estimated 800 languages are spoken in New York City,[24][25][26] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[27][28] The New York City metropolitan region is home to the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world, approximately 5.9 million as of 2023. New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York,[29] before being permanently renamed New York in 1674. Following independence from Great Britain, the city was the national capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[30] The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world\'s premier financial and fintech center[31][32] and the most economically powerful city in the world.[33] As of 2022[update], the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion.[11] The New York metropolitan area\'s economy is larger than all but nine countries. Despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system, New York also leads the world in urban automobile traffic congestion.[34] The city is home to the world\'s two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is an established haven for global investors.[35] As of 2025[update], New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates[36] and has by a wide margin the highest residential rents of any city in the nation.[37] Fifth Avenue is the most expensive shopping street in the world.[38] New York City is home to the highest number of billionaires,[39] individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million),[40] and millionaires of any city in the world by a significant margin.[41]  Etymology  See also: Nicknames of New York City  In 1664, New York was named in honor of the Duke of York (later King James II of England).[42] James\'s elder brother, King Charles II, appointed him proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when the Kingdom of England seized it from Dutch control.[43] At the same time, New Netherland was also renamed New York (province, now New York State).[44]  History  Main articles: History of New York City and Timeline of New York City  Further information: History of Manhattan, Timeline of Brooklyn, Timeline of Queens, Timeline of the Bronx, and Timeline of Staten Island  Early history  Main article: History of New York City (prehistory–1664)  In the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquians, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.[45]  The first documented visit to New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano.[46] He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême).[47] A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Río de San Antonio (\'Saint Anthony\'s River\').[48]  In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.[49] He sailed up what the Dutch called North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange.[50]  Hudson claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (\'New Netherland\'). The first non–Native American inhabitant of what became New York City was Juan Rodriguez, a merchant from Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch.[51][52]  Dutch rule  Main articles: New Amsterdam, Fort Amsterdam, and New Netherland    The Castello Plan, a 1660 map of New Amsterdam in Lower Manhattan    New Amsterdam, centered in what eventually became Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it New York  A permanent European presence near New York Harbor was established in 1624, making New York the 12th-oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States, with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.[53][54]  The colony of New Amsterdam extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7 m) wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids.[55] In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[56] for ""the value of 60 guilders""[57] (about $900 in 2018).[58] A frequently told but disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[59][60]  Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[29] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded land, local political autonomy, and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[61]  Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639–1640, to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[29][62]  In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[63][64] Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order; however, he earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups from establishing houses of worship.[65]  English rule  Main articles: Province of New York and History of New York City (1665–1783)    The Fall of New Amsterdam, painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris, depicting the Conquest of New Netherland    Fort George and New York with British warships, c. 1731  In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed.[65][66] The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[67]  In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the victorious Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname, which they had gained from the English,[68] and in return the English kept New Amsterdam. The settlement was promptly renamed ""New York"" after the Duke of York (the future King James II and VII).[3] The duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley.[69]  On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Anthony Colve of the Dutch navy seized New York at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it ""New Orange"" after William III, the Prince of Orange.[70] The Dutch soon returned the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.[71][72]  Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between 1660 and 1670.[73] By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.[74] New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population in 1702 alone.[75][76]  In the early 18th century, New York grew in importance as a trading port as a part of the colony of New York.[77] It became a center of slavery, with 42% of households enslaving Africans by 1730.[78] Most were domestic slaves; others were hired out as labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York\'s economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the American South. During construction in Foley Square in the 1990s, the African Burying Ground was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 graves of colonial-era Africans, some enslaved and some free.[79]  The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish freedom of the press in North America.[80] In 1754, Columbia University was founded.[81]  American Revolution  Further information: American Revolution  The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.[82] The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within modern-day Brooklyn.[83] A British rout of the Continental Army at the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776 eliminated the last American stronghold in Manhattan, causing George Washington and his forces to retreat across the Hudson River to New Jersey, pursued by British forces.[84][85]  After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made New York their military and political base of operations in North America.[86] The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom promised by the Crown, with as many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation, the largest such community on the continent.[87][88] When the British forces evacuated New York at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia, England, and the Caribbean.[89]  The attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776.[90] Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York destroyed nearly 500 buildings, about a quarter of the structures in the city, including Trinity Church.[91][92]  Post-revolutionary period and early 19th century  Main article: History of New York City (1784–1854)  In January 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital.[93] New York was the last capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation and the first under the Constitution.[94] As the capital, New York City hosted the inauguration of the first President, George Washington, and the first Congress, at Federal Hall on Wall Street. Congress drafted the Bill of Rights there.[94] The Supreme Court held its first organizational sessions in New York in 1790. In 1790, for the first time, New York City surpassed Philadelphia as the nation\'s largest city. At the end of 1790, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia, where it remained while the new capital in Washington, D.C. was being constructed.[95][96]  During the 19th century New York City\'s population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million.[97] Under New York State\'s gradual emancipation act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.[98][99] A significant free Black population gradually developed in Manhattan, made up of former slaves who had been freed by their masters after the American Revolutionary War, as well as escaped slaves. The New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children.[100] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state.[101] Free Blacks struggled with discrimination, and interracial abolitionist activism continued. New York City\'s population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 (10,886 of whom were Black and of whom 518 were enslaved) to 312,710 by 1840 (16,358 of whom were Black).[102]  Also in the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration, respectively.[104] The city adopted the Commissioners\' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.[105] Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.[106] In 1831, New York University was founded.[107]  Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Members of the business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.[108]  The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, of whom more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, representing over a quarter of the city\'s population.[109] Extensive immigration from the German provinces meant that Germans comprised another 25% of New York\'s population by 1860.[110][111]  American Civil War  Main articles: New York City in the American Civil War and History of New York City (1855–1897)  Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city\'s ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[100] Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[100]  The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York\'s elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground.[110] At least 120 people were killed.[112] Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865. The White working class had established dominance.[110][112] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.[113]  Late 19th and early 20th century  Main articles: History of New York City (1898–1945) and History of New York City (1946–1977)  In 1886, the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was dedicated in New York Harbor. The statue welcomed 14 million immigrants as they arrived via Ellis Island by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the United States and American ideals of liberty and peace.[114][115]  In 1898 the City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.[116] The opening of the New York City Subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together.[117] Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.[118]  In 1904 the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people.[119] In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city\'s worst industrial disaster, killed 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies\' Garment Workers\' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.[120]  New York\'s non-White population was 36,620 in 1890.[121] New York City was a prime destination in the early 20th century for Blacks during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had the largest urban African diaspora in North America.[122] The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition.[123] The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height.[124]  New York City became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed 10 million in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity.[125] The Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[126]  Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County, with Wall Street leading America\'s place as the world\'s dominant economic power. The United Nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York\'s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York\'s displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.[127]  Late 20th and early 21st centuries  Main articles: History of New York City (1978–present) and September 11 attacks  In 1969 the Stonewall riots were a series of violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village.[131] They are widely considered to be the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement[128][132][133][134] and the modern fight for LGBT rights.[135][136] Wayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only ""transgender folks around"" during the Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality.[137]  In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[138] Growing fiscal deficits in 1975 led the city to appeal to the federal government for financial aid; President Gerald Ford gave a speech denying the request, which was paraphrased on the front page of the New York Daily News as ""FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD"".[139] The Municipal Assistance Corporation was formed and granted oversight authority over the city\'s finances.[140] While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city\'s economic health in the 1980s, New York\'s crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[141]  New York City\'s population passed 8 million for the first time in the 2000 census;[142] further records were set in the 2010 and 2020 censuses.[143] Important new economic sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged.[144]  The year 2000 was celebrated with fanfare in Times Square.[145]  New York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.[146] Two of the four hijacked airliners were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, resulting in the collapse of both buildings and the deaths of 2,753 people, including 343 first responders from the New York City Fire Department and 71 law enforcement officers.[147]  The area was rebuilt with a new World Trade Center, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure,[148] including the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city\'s third-largest hub.[149] The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere[150] and the world\'s seventh-tallest building by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m), a reference to the year of American independence.[151][152][153]  The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[154]  New York City was heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, including flooding that led to the days-long shutdown of the subway system,[155] and flooding of all East River subway tunnels and of all road tunnels entering Manhattan except the Lincoln Tunnel.[156] The New York Stock Exchange closed for two days due to weather for the first time since the Great Blizzard of 1888.[157] At least 43 people died in New York City as a result of Sandy, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion.[158] The disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter climate change and rising seas, with $15 billion in federal funding received through 2022 towards those resiliency efforts.[159][160]  In March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in the city was confirmed.[161] With its population density and extensive exposure to global travelers, the city rapidly replaced Wuhan, China as the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, straining the city\'s healthcare infrastructure.[162][163] Through March 2023, New York City recorded more than 80,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications.[164]  Geography  Main articles: Geography of New York City and Geography of New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary  New York City lies in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.', 'Retrieved August 20, 2017. ^ Jump up to: a b c Highest Density States, Counties and Cities (2022), United States Census Bureau.

How did Galapagos Islands get its name?,"['Because of subsequent evolutionary adaptations, an amazing range of subspecies are found on the islands today. Galapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine iguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Other species of interest include the flightless cormorant and the blue-footed booby. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young. The islands’ human inhabitants, mostly Ecuadorans, live in settlements on San Cristóbal, Santa María, Isabela, and Santa Cruz islands; Baltra has an Ecuadoran military base. Some of the islands are virtually untouched by humans, but many have been altered by the introduction of nonnative plants, the growth of the local human population, and tourist traffic.

The Galapagos consist of 13 major islands (ranging in area from 5.4 to 1,771 square miles [14 to 4,588 square km]), 6 smaller islands, and scores of islets and rocks lying athwart the Equator 600 miles (1,000 km) west of the mainland of Ecuador. Their total land area of 3,093 square miles (8,010 square km) is scattered over 23,000 square miles (59,500 square km) of ocean. The government of Ecuador designated part of the Galapagos a wildlife sanctuary in 1935, and in 1959 the sanctuary became the Galapagos National Park. In 1978 the islands were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, and in 1986 the Galapagos Marine Resources Reserve was created to protect the surrounding waters. The Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz (Indefatigable) Island promotes scientific studies and protects the indigenous vegetation and animal life of the Galapagos. The Galapagos Islands are formed of lava piles and dotted with shield volcanoes, many of which are periodically active. The striking ruggedness of the arid landscape is accentuated by high volcanic mountains, craters, and cliffs. The largest of the islands, Isabela (Albemarle), is approximately 82 miles (132 km) long and constitutes more than half of the total land area of the archipelago; it contains Mount Azul, at 5,541 feet (1,689 metres) the highest point of the Galapagos Islands. The second largest island is Santa Cruz. The Galapagos Islands were discovered in 1535 by the bishop of Panama, Tomás de Berlanga, whose ship had drifted off course while en route to Peru. He named them Las Encantadas (“The Enchanted”), and in his writings he marveled at the thousands of large galápagos (tortoises) found there. Numerous Spanish voyagers stopped at the islands from the 16th century, and the Galapagos also came to be used by pirates and by whale and seal hunters. The area had been unclaimed for almost 300 years before colonization began on what is now Santa María Island in 1832, when Ecuador took official possession of the archipelago. The islands became internationally famous as a result of their being visited in 1835 by the English naturalist Charles Darwin; their unusual fauna contributed to the groundbreaking theories on natural selection presented in his On the Origin of Species (1859). Island, New Caledonia. Britannica Quiz  Islands and Archipelagos  The climate of the Galapagos Islands is characterized by low rainfall, low humidity, and relatively low air and water temperatures. The islands have thousands of plant and animal species, of which the vast majority are endemic. The archipelago’s arid lowlands are covered by an open cactus forest. A transition zone at higher elevations is covered with a forest in which pisonia (a four o’clock plant) and guava trees dominate, and the moist forest region above the transition zone is dominated by a Scalesia forest with dense underbrush.

It is located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world\'s largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each coextensive with its respective county. The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a global center of finance[13] and commerce, culture, technology,[14] entertainment and media, academics and scientific output,[15] the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy.[16][17][18][19][20]  With an estimated population in July 2024 of 8,478,072, distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2),[5] the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States.[6][7] New York City has more than double the population of Los Angeles, the country\'s second-most populous city.[21] Over 20.1 million people live in New York City\'s metropolitan statistical area[22] and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, both the largest in the U.S. New York City is one of the world\'s most populous megacities.[23] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. An estimated 800 languages are spoken in New York City,[24][25][26] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[27][28] The New York City metropolitan region is home to the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world, approximately 5.9 million as of 2023. New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York,[29] before being permanently renamed New York in 1674. Following independence from Great Britain, the city was the national capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[30] The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world\'s premier financial and fintech center[31][32] and the most economically powerful city in the world.[33] As of 2022[update], the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion.[11] The New York metropolitan area\'s economy is larger than all but nine countries. Despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system, New York also leads the world in urban automobile traffic congestion.[34] The city is home to the world\'s two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is an established haven for global investors.[35] As of 2025[update], New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates[36] and has by a wide margin the highest residential rents of any city in the nation.[37] Fifth Avenue is the most expensive shopping street in the world.[38] New York City is home to the highest number of billionaires,[39] individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million),[40] and millionaires of any city in the world by a significant margin.[41]  Etymology  See also: Nicknames of New York City  In 1664, New York was named in honor of the Duke of York (later King James II of England).[42] James\'s elder brother, King Charles II, appointed him proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when the Kingdom of England seized it from Dutch control.[43] At the same time, New Netherland was also renamed New York (province, now New York State).[44]  History  Main articles: History of New York City and Timeline of New York City  Further information: History of Manhattan, Timeline of Brooklyn, Timeline of Queens, Timeline of the Bronx, and Timeline of Staten Island  Early history  Main article: History of New York City (prehistory–1664)  In the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquians, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.[45]  The first documented visit to New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano.[46] He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême).[47] A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Río de San Antonio (\'Saint Anthony\'s River\').[48]  In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.[49] He sailed up what the Dutch called North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange.[50]  Hudson claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (\'New Netherland\'). The first non–Native American inhabitant of what became New York City was Juan Rodriguez, a merchant from Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch.[51][52]  Dutch rule  Main articles: New Amsterdam, Fort Amsterdam, and New Netherland    The Castello Plan, a 1660 map of New Amsterdam in Lower Manhattan    New Amsterdam, centered in what eventually became Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it New York  A permanent European presence near New York Harbor was established in 1624, making New York the 12th-oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States, with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.[53][54]  The colony of New Amsterdam extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7 m) wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids.[55] In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[56] for ""the value of 60 guilders""[57] (about $900 in 2018).[58] A frequently told but disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[59][60]  Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[29] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded land, local political autonomy, and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[61]  Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639–1640, to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[29][62]  In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[63][64] Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order; however, he earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups from establishing houses of worship.[65]  English rule  Main articles: Province of New York and History of New York City (1665–1783)    The Fall of New Amsterdam, painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris, depicting the Conquest of New Netherland    Fort George and New York with British warships, c. 1731  In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed.[65][66] The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[67]  In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the victorious Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname, which they had gained from the English,[68] and in return the English kept New Amsterdam. The settlement was promptly renamed ""New York"" after the Duke of York (the future King James II and VII).[3] The duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley.[69]  On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Anthony Colve of the Dutch navy seized New York at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it ""New Orange"" after William III, the Prince of Orange.[70] The Dutch soon returned the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.[71][72]  Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between 1660 and 1670.[73] By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.[74] New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population in 1702 alone.[75][76]  In the early 18th century, New York grew in importance as a trading port as a part of the colony of New York.[77] It became a center of slavery, with 42% of households enslaving Africans by 1730.[78] Most were domestic slaves; others were hired out as labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York\'s economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the American South. During construction in Foley Square in the 1990s, the African Burying Ground was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 graves of colonial-era Africans, some enslaved and some free.[79]  The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish freedom of the press in North America.[80] In 1754, Columbia University was founded.[81]  American Revolution  Further information: American Revolution  The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.[82] The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within modern-day Brooklyn.[83] A British rout of the Continental Army at the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776 eliminated the last American stronghold in Manhattan, causing George Washington and his forces to retreat across the Hudson River to New Jersey, pursued by British forces.[84][85]  After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made New York their military and political base of operations in North America.[86] The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom promised by the Crown, with as many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation, the largest such community on the continent.[87][88] When the British forces evacuated New York at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia, England, and the Caribbean.[89]  The attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776.[90] Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York destroyed nearly 500 buildings, about a quarter of the structures in the city, including Trinity Church.[91][92]  Post-revolutionary period and early 19th century  Main article: History of New York City (1784–1854)  In January 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital.[93] New York was the last capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation and the first under the Constitution.[94] As the capital, New York City hosted the inauguration of the first President, George Washington, and the first Congress, at Federal Hall on Wall Street. Congress drafted the Bill of Rights there.[94] The Supreme Court held its first organizational sessions in New York in 1790. In 1790, for the first time, New York City surpassed Philadelphia as the nation\'s largest city. At the end of 1790, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia, where it remained while the new capital in Washington, D.C. was being constructed.[95][96]  During the 19th century New York City\'s population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million.[97] Under New York State\'s gradual emancipation act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.[98][99] A significant free Black population gradually developed in Manhattan, made up of former slaves who had been freed by their masters after the American Revolutionary War, as well as escaped slaves. The New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children.[100] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state.[101] Free Blacks struggled with discrimination, and interracial abolitionist activism continued. New York City\'s population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 (10,886 of whom were Black and of whom 518 were enslaved) to 312,710 by 1840 (16,358 of whom were Black).[102]  Also in the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration, respectively.[104] The city adopted the Commissioners\' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.[105] Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.[106] In 1831, New York University was founded.[107]  Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Members of the business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.[108]  The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, of whom more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, representing over a quarter of the city\'s population.[109] Extensive immigration from the German provinces meant that Germans comprised another 25% of New York\'s population by 1860.[110][111]  American Civil War  Main articles: New York City in the American Civil War and History of New York City (1855–1897)  Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city\'s ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[100] Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[100]  The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York\'s elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground.[110] At least 120 people were killed.[112] Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865. The White working class had established dominance.[110][112] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.[113]  Late 19th and early 20th century  Main articles: History of New York City (1898–1945) and History of New York City (1946–1977)  In 1886, the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was dedicated in New York Harbor. The statue welcomed 14 million immigrants as they arrived via Ellis Island by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the United States and American ideals of liberty and peace.[114][115]  In 1898 the City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.[116] The opening of the New York City Subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together.[117] Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.[118]  In 1904 the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people.[119] In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city\'s worst industrial disaster, killed 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies\' Garment Workers\' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.[120]  New York\'s non-White population was 36,620 in 1890.[121] New York City was a prime destination in the early 20th century for Blacks during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had the largest urban African diaspora in North America.[122] The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition.[123] The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height.[124]  New York City became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed 10 million in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity.[125] The Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[126]  Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County, with Wall Street leading America\'s place as the world\'s dominant economic power. The United Nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York\'s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York\'s displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.[127]  Late 20th and early 21st centuries  Main articles: History of New York City (1978–present) and September 11 attacks  In 1969 the Stonewall riots were a series of violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village.[131] They are widely considered to be the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement[128][132][133][134] and the modern fight for LGBT rights.[135][136] Wayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only ""transgender folks around"" during the Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality.[137]  In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[138] Growing fiscal deficits in 1975 led the city to appeal to the federal government for financial aid; President Gerald Ford gave a speech denying the request, which was paraphrased on the front page of the New York Daily News as ""FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD"".[139] The Municipal Assistance Corporation was formed and granted oversight authority over the city\'s finances.[140] While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city\'s economic health in the 1980s, New York\'s crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[141]  New York City\'s population passed 8 million for the first time in the 2000 census;[142] further records were set in the 2010 and 2020 censuses.[143] Important new economic sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged.[144]  The year 2000 was celebrated with fanfare in Times Square.[145]  New York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.[146] Two of the four hijacked airliners were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, resulting in the collapse of both buildings and the deaths of 2,753 people, including 343 first responders from the New York City Fire Department and 71 law enforcement officers.[147]  The area was rebuilt with a new World Trade Center, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure,[148] including the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city\'s third-largest hub.[149] The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere[150] and the world\'s seventh-tallest building by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m), a reference to the year of American independence.[151][152][153]  The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[154]  New York City was heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, including flooding that led to the days-long shutdown of the subway system,[155] and flooding of all East River subway tunnels and of all road tunnels entering Manhattan except the Lincoln Tunnel.[156] The New York Stock Exchange closed for two days due to weather for the first time since the Great Blizzard of 1888.[157] At least 43 people died in New York City as a result of Sandy, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion.[158] The disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter climate change and rising seas, with $15 billion in federal funding received through 2022 towards those resiliency efforts.[159][160]  In March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in the city was confirmed.[161] With its population density and extensive exposure to global travelers, the city rapidly replaced Wuhan, China as the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, straining the city\'s healthcare infrastructure.[162][163] Through March 2023, New York City recorded more than 80,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications.[164]  Geography  Main articles: Geography of New York City and Geography of New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary  New York City lies in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.', 'October 19, 2015.
